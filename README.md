# Nutritional Recipe Analyzer

This web app allows users to analyze the nutritional content of recipes by inputting ingredients and their quantities. Built using Python and Streamlit, the app integrates the USDA FoodData Central API to fetch nutrient information for each ingredient. Users can interactively add ingredients using the "Add More" button and calculate the total nutritional breakdown with the "Calculate" button. The nutritional content is displayed in a clear table format, and ingredients can be reset at any time with the "Clear" button. The app provides an intuitive interface for those interested in understanding the nutritional profile of their meals.
